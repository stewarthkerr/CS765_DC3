# Instructions

### Design 1
Design 1 can be run by pasting the code in `code/treemap.html` and `code/treemap.js` into [JSFiddle.net].

### Design 2
Design 2 can be run from [this link](https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree). You will need to upload the file `data/root_data_collapsible_tree.json` by clicking the "File" button on Observable. Then, you must change the line `data = FileAttachment("flare-2.json").json()` to `data = FileAttachment("root_data_collaspible_tree.json").json()`.

### Design 3
Design 3 can be run from [this link](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing?collection=@d3/d3-hierarchy). You will need to upload the file `data/data_bubble1.json` by clicking the "File" button on Observable. Then, you must change the line `data = FileAttachment("flare-2.json").json()` to `data = FileAttachment("data_bubble1.json").json()`.

### Design 4
Design 4 can be run by opening `code/tree_altair.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook. Note that you will need to install the packages included at the top of the notebook.
